<h3>Create Virtual Machine in Azure</h3>

<p>
Create a Resource Group and create a Virtual Machine (VM) with 2-4 Virtual CPUs. I used Windows 10 as my operating system. Make sure to allow the VM to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet).

<h3>Install/Enable Internet Installation Services (IIS)</h3>

<p>
Connect to your VM with Remote Desktop. Once you are in, install and enable Internet Information Services (IIS). To do this, go to your Control Panel, then click on "Uninstall or change programs". From here, click on "Turn Windows features on or off" on the left side of the screen. Scroll down to IIS and check the box next to it. Now click OK. Now you can install IIS.

<h3>Install Web Platform Installer</h3>

<p>
Install Web Platform Installer from this <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6"> link</a>. Once installed, add the programs listed in the photo above. When you add MySQL 5.5, it will ask you for credential to be created later. I used "root" as the name and "Password1" as the password.

There will be programs that failed to install. They will be in the installation files <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6"> link</a>. The files you want to install are PHP Version 7.3.8, PHP Manager 1.5.0 for IIS 10 and Microsoft Visual C++ 2009 Redistributable Package(vcredist_x86.exe).
